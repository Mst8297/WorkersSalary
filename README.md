# WorkersSalary
Authors: Ester Moiseyev, Yogev Tamir
This program allows us to list employees. You can enter an employee manually or enter a list of 10000 employees.
Currently the 10000 employees can be added randomly.
After adding an employee in any way, the user can select one employee from the list and calculate the tax that the employee must pay according to his salary.
We we're asked to write this program in order to check the speed of sorting.
Also after every employee sort, the running time of the sorting is printed un the program's window.
About the main files:
  1.Form1- the program is shown on this window only
  2.WorkersDetails.cs- responsible on the workers list. The constructor of the worker is in there.
  3.Form1Tests.cs - contains the test we ran on our program.
